***Install, configure, and use a simple Prometheus instance***

- Launch an Amazon EC2 instance with setting seen below:  

- [Download the latest release](https://prometheus.io/download/) of Prometheus for linux. Select *.linux-*.tar.gz

```bash
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.31.0-rc.0/prometheus-2.31.0-rc.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
Extract and run it.

```bash
tar xvfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
cd prometheus-*

- Check the basic prometheus configuration.

```
cat prometheus.yml
```

Output:

```yaml
```
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

# Alertmanager configuration
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
          # - alertmanager:9093

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
rule_files:
  # - "first_rules.yml"
  # - "second_rules.yml"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any time series scraped from this config.
  - job_name: "prometheus"

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
```
```
- Start Prometheus.

```bash
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```
